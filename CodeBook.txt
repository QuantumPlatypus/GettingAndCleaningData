Code Book
=========

The features in this data set represent the processing of the raw data detailed in the UCI HAR Dataset.  THe raw data are well described in the original code book files.

From the raw data, only the mean and standard deviation variables for each measure were chosen.  These variables are listed in full at the end of this code book, and constitute all but the first two columns of data.  Each of these variables was averaged for each subject performing each activity.  The first two columns indicate whish Subject and which activity each row of data represents.
